They exist only in vector, as the shortest way between two points. You can cheat and use a ruler, but most likely your hand will never learn to draw a perfectly straight, long lines. Even if it starts as something perfect, the longer you draw it, the more mistakes can be made. What does it mean?</p><p style="font-size: 18px;">If drawing a long line is almost impossible, we can use short lines that our hand is more adapted for. Just look at the picture below. The shorter the lines, the closer to the original the picture is.</p><figure style="text-align: center;font-size: 18px;"><img width="600" alt="iwanttodraw-1-1-short-lines" src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/vector/uploads/2013/12/iwanttodraw-1-1-short-lines.png" height="570" style="text-align: center;"/><br/></figure><h3 class="nolinks" style="font-size: 21px;"><b>Step 2</b></h3><p style="font-size: 18px;">Let''s say you want to draw a flower like below. You can see it''s built of a straight line, a perfect circle and a few of curves with precise angles. I guess you can draw it very slowly, very carefully driving the lines from point to point, with your tongue stuck out and sweat on your face. But... why? Drawing isn''t a chore, it should be fun!</p><figure style="text-align: center;font-size: 18px;"><img width="600" alt="iwanttodraw-1-2-draw-flower" src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/vector/uploads/2013/12/iwanttodraw-1-2-draw-flower.png" height="415" style="text-align: center;"/><br/></figure><h3 class="nolinks" style="font-size: 21px;"><b>Step 3</b></h3><p style="font-size: 18px;">Technical drawing (straight lines, perfect circles) requires concentration.

Draw <em>the same things</em> exactly <em>the same way</em> all the time?</p><p style="font-size: 18px;">If you do, well, there''s no tutorial for you. Because drawing - creation - is about keeping your hand relaxed while being focused on a final effect instead of creating a series of perfect lines. That''s what you need to learn - how to keep relaxed, sketch fast and carelessly. Let''s try to draw this flower once again, shall we? But this time follow these simple rules:</p><ul style="font-size: 18px;"><li>Divide the long lines into short ones;</li><li>The more curves, the shorter the lines;</li><li>Touch the paper very lightly, don''t press your pencil hard;</li><li>Keep it fast!</li></ul><figure style="text-align: center;font-size: 18px;"><img width="600" alt="iwanttodraw-1-3-draw-flower-ani" src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/vector/uploads/2013/12/iwanttodraw-1-3-draw-flower-ani.gif" height="450" style="text-align: center;"/><br/></figure><figure style="text-align: center;font-size: 18px;"><img width="600" alt="iwanttodraw-1-3-draw-flower" src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/vector/uploads/2013/12/iwanttodraw-1-3-draw-flower.png" height="414" style="text-align: center;"/><br/></figure><h3 class="nolinks" style="font-size: 21px;"><b>Step 4</b></h3><p style="font-size: 18px;">Wasn''t that fun?

The rules from the previous step still apply.</p><figure style="text-align: center;font-size: 18px;"><img width="600" alt="iwanttodraw-1-4-draw-flower" src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/vector/uploads/2013/12/iwanttodraw-1-4-draw-flower.png" height="414" style="text-align: center;"/><br/></figure><h3 class="nolinks" style="font-size: 21px;"><b>Step 5</b></h3><p style="font-size: 18px;">You can now stress the defined lines with a marker or pressing the pencil harder.

It doesn''t look exactly like original, but you can see some style in it, a bit of your personal character, a real work of your hands! You can notice it even looks more natural than the original, because nature isn''t perfect. What''s most important, once you cross the boundaries, you can easily change everything! Paradoxically, the less accurate your lines, the more natural the drawing.</p><figure style="text-align: center;font-size: 18px;"><img width="600" alt="iwanttodraw-1-6-draw-flower" src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/vector/uploads/2013/12/iwanttodraw-1-6-draw-flower.png" height="424" style="text-align: center;"/><br/></figure><h3 class="nolinks" style="font-size: 21px;"><b>Step 7</b></h3><p style="font-size: 18px;">What to practice?</p><ul style="font-size: 18px;"><li>Divide the lines into short ones;</li><li>Draw circles made of short lines instead of long, ever-bending one;</li><li>Draw lightly - this way your little mistakes won''t be visible.</li></ul><figure style="text-align: center;font-size: 18px;"><img width="600" alt="iwanttodraw-1-7-draw-fast" src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/vector/uploads/2013/12/iwanttodraw-1-7-draw-fast.png" height="586" style="text-align: center;"/></figure>', '09/11/2016 18:31', 'Straight lines aren''t real.', 'Break the Straight Line', 2, 0.00, 0, 5, 6);

Well, the first step of this tutorial is good for you too, but there''s another trick you can use.</p><p style="font-size: 18px;">As I said before, style comes from diversity. If you''re redrawing a picture carefully, line by line, without adding anything new (because it would be a mistake!), you can''t end up with something different. The original wasn''t yours, and your drawing is just its copy. I don''t say you shouldn''t follow tutorials anymore - you should just be more creative and - paradoxically - less precise when doing it.</p><p style="font-size: 18px;">How to lose a reasonable bit of precision? Let''s start with this simple exercise: draw a few simple shapes with your hand shaking, as if you were being nervous. Do it until you feel your hand is relaxed.</p><figure style="text-align: center;font-size: 18px;"><img width="600" alt="iwanttodraw-2-1-shake-hand" src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/vector/uploads/2013/12/iwanttodraw-2-1-shake-hand.gif" height="522" style="text-align: center;"/><br/></figure><h3 class="nolinks" style="font-size: 21px;"><b>Step 2</b></h3><p style="font-size: 18px;">Let''s try this simple tutorial now.

Every head looks different than the original, but you can recognize what you''ve just drawn. Also, you used the same proportions for them all, yet none of them looks identical. How could it have happened?</p><p style="font-size: 18px;">When you were learning how to write, your teacher wanted you to repeat lines from a template. You were spending a lot of time drawing (not writing) every single letter as if it was a small masterpiece. Then, with time and experience, you developed your own character of writing, your own style. Your letters look different than mine or your friends'' - still, we can all read what you write. Your style changed because you wanted to write fast - to write down your thoughts, not to draw perfect, but meaningless letters.</p><p style="font-size: 18px;">Apply this rule to your drawings. Think about what you want to achieve, not about the lines. Draw fast and your personal, unique hand movement will have a chance to shine.</p><figure style="text-align: center;font-size: 18px;"><img width="600" alt="iwanttodraw-2-3-lose-precision" src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/vector/uploads/2013/12/iwanttodraw-2-3-lose-precision.png" height="464" style="text-align: center;"/><br/></figure><h3 class="nolinks" style="font-size: 21px;"><b>Step 4</b></h3><p style="font-size: 18px;">There''s another thing that adds up to your style - creativity.

Luckily, it can be overcome if you don''t ignore it. First, what are they, actually?</p><p style="font-size: 18px;">Proportions aren''t a distance measured in some unit. They define a location of an element relative to others. It means that if you want to draw all the picture (set of elements) two times bigger, all the distances need to be doubled too.</p><figure style="text-align: center;font-size: 18px;"><img width="600" alt="iwanttodraw-3-1-proportions" src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/vector/uploads/2013/12/iwanttodraw-3-1-proportions.png" height="445" style="text-align: center;"/><br/></figure><h3 class="nolinks" style="font-size: 21px;"><b>Step 2</b></h3><p style="font-size: 18px;">Let''s train our eyes to see and redraw proportions.

And, how''s your result? Probably not very good, if you''re reading this tutorial. Notice that the circles should be two times smaller too, and that seems almost impossible - how to draw a twice bigger circle, if you don''t even know the original size?</p><p style="font-size: 18px;">The answer is we need at least two elements to talk about relativity. No matter what size the first element is - it can''t be unproportional, if there''s only one! So, let''s try once again. Draw only the first circle.</p><figure style="text-align: center;font-size: 18px;"><img width="600" alt="iwanttodraw-3-3-proportions" src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/vector/uploads/2013/12/iwanttodraw-3-3-proportions.png" height="445" style="text-align: center;"/><br/></figure><h3 class="nolinks" style="font-size: 21px;"><b>Step 4</b></h3><p style="font-size: 18px;">Now imagine two lines coming from the center of the circle.

How many circles can be put between both centers in the original? Apply this relationship to your picture. For the first time it''s the best to print the original and draw the other circles physically, later you can try with only pretending you''re drawing them (keeping the pencil right above the paper/screen and seeing the circles in mind).</p><figure style="text-align: center;font-size: 18px;"><img width="600" alt="iwanttodraw-3-5-proportions" src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/vector/uploads/2013/12/iwanttodraw-3-5-proportions.png" height="445" style="text-align: center;"/><br/></figure><h3 class="nolinks" style="font-size: 21px;"><b>Step 6</b></h3><p style="font-size: 18px;">It''s almost done!

Also, with time your eyes will learn to do it without your awareness!</li><li>If you have problems with recreating sizes (for example, you draw two identical circles and they''re always different), don''t avoid practicing it.

You only need to change your attitude. The problem is you learn how to draw lines instead of what the object is. There are two kinds of information:</p><ul><li>Matrix (raster): where''s the point? What''s it connected to? How long is the distance between them? How many of them occurs on a given area?</li><li>Vector: what''s the point for? What is this point part of? What does this set of points do? How does it influence the other elements?</li></ul><p>Matrix information is a template to create the same thing all over again. It''s hard to remember and it''s useful only at few cases. Vector information is scalable. It means that when conditions change (different pose, size, style), the elements adjust to them, because they''re attached to proportions, not position. Here comes an example:</p><li>Matrix dog head information:</li><ul><li>C1 - nose;</li><li>C3 - eye;</li><li>C1-E3 - mouth;</li><li>A3-E5 - head (etc).</li></ul><li>Vector dog head information:</li><ul><li>The head is made of two circles - a &#34;brain case&#34; and a mouth;</li><li>The mouth is a bit higher than the middle of the brain case;</li><li>The eye is circular and it starts at the middle of the brain case, touching the mouth;</li><li>The nose is on the tip of the mouth, it''s as big as the eye (etc).</li></ul><figure style="text-align: center;"><img width="600" alt="iwanttodraw-5-1-draw-from-imagination" src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/vector/uploads/2013/12/iwanttodraw-5-1-draw-from-imagination.png" height="445" style="text-align: center;"/><br/></figure><p>If you like to change something, for example open the mouth, matrix information fails. It''s fixed, scalable only in terms of size, and it''s even more useless when you want to create a pose in 3D space. How to learn in vector then?</p><h3 class="nolinks" style="font-size: 21px;"><b>Step 2</b></h3><p>Take an object and analyze it. There are two ways of thinking you can go now (I''ll use a glass as an example):</p><ul><li>The glass is made of a rectangle, then there''s a flat triangle under it, a quite long line and a flat triangle again;</li><li>The glass is made of an oblong container with circular section where wine is poured. The upper part of the container can be bent to inside, to reduce slipping away of the bubbles. The bottom of the container melts gently into a thick leg. The leg is then melting into circular support.</li></ul><p>What do you think, which way better describes an essence of a glass? The first one is fast and great when you start your adventure with drawing, but it will only let you draw this particular position. You may try to go into a 3D world, learn perspective, add some motion, and suddenly it turns out you don''t really know how to draw a glass.</p><figure style="text-align: center;"><img width="600" alt="iwanttodraw-5-2-draw-from-imagination" src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/vector/uploads/2013/12/iwanttodraw-5-2-draw-from-imagination.png" height="445" style="text-align: center;"/><br/></figure><h3 class="nolinks" style="font-size: 21px;"><b>Step 3</b></h3><p>Another example is anatomy. You may learn curves of a body in one pose, but it doesn''t tell you anything about what the same body looks when running/sitting/fighting. A simple &#34;why&#34; has never been that powerful. Why is this part bulging? What''s it used for? Why is it long/short? Why is this part connected to some particular one?</p><figure style="text-align: center;"><img width="600" alt="iwanttodraw-5-3-draw-from-imagination" src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/vector/uploads/2013/12/iwanttodraw-5-3-draw-from-imagination.png" height="445" style="text-align: center;"/><br/></figure><h3 class="nolinks" style="font-size: 21px;"><b>Step 4</b></h3><p>What to practice?</p><ul><li>Stop thoughtlessly copying the lines you''re seeing. Try to understand the object as a whole. If you understand why it''s built and drawn like this, you''ll be able to modify it and create something truly yours without breaking the rules;</li><li>Analyze objects even when you don''t draw. In a queue, in a bus, waiting for someone - look around and ask yourself: why does it look like this? What''s its purpose? With every answered &#34;why&#34; you''re extending a huge base of a vector information in your head. You''ll be surprised how much it helps!</li></ul><figure style="text-align: center;"><img width="600" alt="iwanttodraw-5-4-draw-from-imagination" src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/vector/uploads/2013/12/iwanttodraw-5-4-draw-from-imagination.png" height="501" style="text-align: center;"/><br/></figure><h2 class="nolinks" style="font-size: 31px;"><b>Now You''re Ready to Draw!</b></h2><p>If you followed the tutorial carefully, after some practice you should be able to follow intermediate tutorials flawlessly.
